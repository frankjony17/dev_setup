## Caveats

This project is a work in progress and will always have room for improvement.

Keep the following in mind if you wish to use or extend it:

    •	Changes can affect multiple files, which may cause some confusion
    •	There is no parallelism in the execution of scripts
    •	The script may be interrupted when requesting sudo permissions at certain steps
    •	There is no upgrade option, only reinstallation
